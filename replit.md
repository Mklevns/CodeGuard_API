# CodeGuard API - Replit Development Guide

## Overview

CodeGuard is a FastAPI-based backend service that provides static code analysis for machine learning (ML) and reinforcement learning (RL) Python code. The service analyzes code files for syntax errors, style issues, and production concerns, returning structured audit results with fix suggestions. This service is designed to be consumed by OpenAI Actions via an OpenAPI specification.

## System Architecture

### Core Architecture
- **Framework**: FastAPI for modern, async API development with built-in OpenAPI support
- **Runtime**: Uvicorn ASGI server for production deployment
- **Language**: Python 3.10+ for compatibility with modern static analysis tools
- **Deployment**: Replit-hosted server exposing public HTTPS endpoints

### Analysis Engine
- **Primary Analyzer**: flake8 for syntax, style, and linting analysis
- **File Processing**: Temporary file system for secure code analysis
- **Security**: Input sanitization to prevent path traversal attacks

## Key Components

### 1. API Layer (`main.py`)
- **FastAPI Application**: Main application with CORS middleware for cross-origin requests
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /` - Service information and available endpoints
  - `POST /audit` - Main code analysis endpoint
- **OpenAPI Integration**: Automatic schema generation at `/openapi.json`

### 2. Data Models (`models.py`)
- **Request Models**:
  - `CodeFile`: Represents individual files with filename and content
  - `AuditOptions`: Optional configuration for analysis level, framework, and target platform
  - `AuditRequest`: Complete audit request with files and options
- **Response Models**:
  - `Issue`: Enhanced with source tool identification and severity levels
  - `Fix`: Extended with diff generation, replacement code, and auto-fix capabilities
  - `AuditResponse`: Complete audit response with multi-tool analysis results

### 3. Enhanced Analysis Engine (`enhanced_audit.py`, `rule_engine.py`)
- **Multi-Tool Integration**: Combines flake8, pylint, mypy, black, isort, and custom ML/RL rules
- **Enhanced Analysis Pipeline**: Parallel execution of multiple static analysis tools
- **ML/RL Pattern Detection**: Custom rules for missing seeding, environment resets, training loop issues
- **Advanced Fix Generation**: Unified diff format and auto-fixable suggestions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when individual tools fail

## Enhanced Data Flow

1. **Request Reception**: Client sends POST request to `/audit` with code files
2. **Input Validation**: Pydantic models validate request structure and content
3. **File Processing**: Files are written to temporary directory with sanitized names
4. **Multi-Tool Analysis**: Parallel execution of flake8, pylint, mypy, black, isort, and ML/RL rules
5. **Result Aggregation**: Issues from all tools are collected with source attribution
6. **Fix Generation**: Advanced suggestions with diffs, replacement code, and auto-fix flags
7. **Response Delivery**: Comprehensive JSON response with enhanced analysis results

## Deployment Strategy

### Replit Hosting
- **Platform**: Replit-hosted server for easy deployment and management
- **Endpoint**: Public HTTPS endpoint for external consumption
- **CORS**: Configured to allow cross-origin requests from any domain

### Production Considerations
