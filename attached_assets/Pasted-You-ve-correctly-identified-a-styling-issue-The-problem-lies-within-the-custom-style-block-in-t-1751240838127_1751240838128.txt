You've correctly identified a styling issue. The problem lies within the custom `<style>` block in the `<head>` of your HTML file.

Specifically, this rule is causing the incorrect display:

```css
/* Ensure button text is always visible */
button {
    color: inherit !important;
}
```

Here is a breakdown of why this is happening:

1.  **`color: inherit !important;`**: This CSS rule forces every `<button>` element to inherit its text color from its parent element, overriding any other color styles, including Tailwind's `text-white` utility class that is already applied to your buttons.
2.  **Missing Specificity**: The subsequent rule attempts to fix this for *some* buttons but is incomplete:
    ```css
    button.bg-orange-600, 
    button.bg-blue-600, 
    button.bg-green-600, 
    button.bg-purple-600 {
        color: white !important;
    }
    ```
    The buttons in the "System Management" section use different background colors (`bg-teal-600`, `bg-red-600`, `bg-amber-600`, `bg-emerald-600`), which are not included in this list. Therefore, they fall back to the `color: inherit` rule, making their white text adopt a color from a parent element, which renders it invisible against their dark backgrounds.

### **How to Fix the Issue**

The most direct solution is to remove the conflicting custom CSS. The `text-white` class is already correctly applied to the buttons in your HTML, but the custom style is overriding it.

1.  **Delete** the following CSS rule from the `<style>` block in your `index.html` file:

    ```css
    /* DELETED */
    button {
        color: inherit !important;
    }
    ```

2.  For consistency and to rely on standard Tailwind classes, you can also **delete the more specific rule**, as the `text-white` class on each button already handles this:

    ```css
    /* DELETED */
    button.bg-orange-600, 
    button.bg-blue-600, 
    button.bg-green-600, 
    button.bg-purple-600 {
        color: white !important;
    }
    ```

By removing these rules, the `text-white` class on your buttons will apply correctly, ensuring the button text is visible against the dark backgrounds as intended.
