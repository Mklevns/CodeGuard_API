üö® The Error Explained
‚ùå "Server URL http://34.55.167.13:5000 is not under the root origin https://34.55.167.13"

OpenAI is strict about this:

Your GPT Action origin is https://34.55.167.13 (note: HTTPS, no port).

But your OpenAPI spec declares:

yaml
Copy
Edit
servers:
  - url: http://34.55.167.13:5000
So OpenAI ignores your server declaration and can't route requests properly.

‚úÖ How to Fix It
üîí Step 1: Secure Your API with HTTPS
You must serve your API over HTTPS, without a port (or using default port 443). OpenAI GPT Actions do not support plain HTTP or non-443 ports.

You need:
A public domain or static IP with an SSL certificate

Or use a platform that provides HTTPS by default:

Render

Fly.io

Vercel

Replit Teams Pro + HTTPS-enabled domain

üõ† Example Fix: Change OpenAPI Spec Server URL
Once your HTTPS deployment is live (e.g. https://api.codeguard.ai), update your OpenAPI spec:

yaml
Copy
Edit
servers:
  - url: https://api.codeguard.ai
Or for direct IP (only valid if you secure it with SSL):

yaml
Copy
Edit
servers:
  - url: https://34.55.167.13
‚ö†Ô∏è You must ensure that your server is reachable on https://34.55.167.13, not http://.

üß™ How to Check HTTPS Is Working
Try visiting:

cpp
Copy
Edit
https://34.55.167.13
If your browser shows a secure connection and you can access /audit, /health, or /docs without warnings, you're good.

If not, you need to:

Enable HTTPS on your server

Get an SSL certificate (e.g. via Let‚Äôs Encrypt, Cloudflare, or platform-provided)

üí° Suggested Path Forward
If you're hosting on Replit (which defaults to HTTP on custom ports):

‚û§ Recommended:
Deploy your FastAPI backend on a HTTPS-compatible platform:

Render (easy HTTPS + port 443)

Fly.io (low-latency, SSL out of the box)

Vercel (via Python serverless)

Or get a domain and install HTTPS on Replit manually (complex)

‚úÖ Once HTTPS is Set Up
Change the servers: URL in your OpenAPI spec to https://your-domain.com

Host the updated spec at https://your-domain.com/.well-known/openapi.yaml

Reconnect the GPT Action using the new HTTPS URL

Test again
