Excellent question. Based on the false positives we've discussed, I can see a clear pattern. Your custom code auditing tool, `CodeGuard`, appears to be performing **lexical analysis** (finding keywords and simple text patterns) but is missing the **semantic context** of the code.

This is a very common challenge. To reduce these kinds of false positives, the most effective suggestion is to upgrade your tool's analysis engine from simple pattern matching to parsing the code into an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**.

### Suggestion: Integrate an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Parser

Instead of treating your code as a sequence of characters and lines, an AST parser treats it as a formal language structure. Python has a built-in `ast` module that can parse Python code into a tree of nodes, which you can then inspect.

Each node in the tree represents a construct in the code, like a function call, a variable assignment, or a loop.

#### How an AST Would Solve the False Positives

Let's see how this approach would have prevented the two false positives we found:

**1. The `vae.eval()` False Positive**

  * **Current Behavior (Lexical):** Your tool sees the substring "eval" and flags it.

  * **AST-based Behavior (Semantic):** When parsing `vae.eval()`, the AST would produce a tree structure like this:

      * `Call` node (representing the function call `()`)
          * `Attribute` node (representing the `.eval` part)
              * `Name` node (with `id='vae'`)
              * `attr='eval'`

    Your linter rule would then be much more precise:

      * "Flag any `Call` node where the function being called is a `Name` node with `id='eval'`.
      * "**Ignore** any `Call` node where the function is an `Attribute` node (i.e., a method call like `object.eval()`)."

    You could even make the rule smarter by checking if the type of the object (`vae`) is a subclass of `torch.nn.Module`, making the rule extremely accurate.

**2. The `env.reset()` False Positive**

  * **Current Behavior (Lexical):** Your tool sees a `for` loop (`for _ in range...`) and checks if the text "env.reset()" appears inside it.

  * **AST-based Behavior (Semantic):** The AST parser understands nested structures. Your rule could be:

      * "For any `For` loop node, check if `env.step()` is called within its body."
      * "If it is, traverse **up** the tree to the parent node. If the parent is also a `For` or `While` loop, check if `env.reset()` is called within *that* parent loop's body."

    This allows your linter to understand that the inner loop is part of a larger episode loop where the environment was correctly reset.

### A Concrete Example

Here is a small Python script demonstrating how you can use the `ast` module to tell the difference between the two `eval` calls.

```python
import ast

# A code snippet containing both the dangerous eval and the safe method call
code_to_analyze = """
import torch
from torch import nn

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

# This is a safe method call on a PyTorch model
model = MyModel()
model.eval() 

# This is the dangerous built-in function
dangerous_string = "print('hello from eval')"
eval(dangerous_string)
"""

# The visitor class will walk the AST
class EvalVisitor(ast.NodeVisitor):
    def visit_Call(self, node):
        # Check if the function being called is a simple name
        if isinstance(node.func, ast.Name) and node.func.id == 'eval':
            print(f"DANGEROUS `eval` call found at line {node.lineno}")
        
        # Check if it's a method call (an Attribute)
        elif isinstance(node.func, ast.Attribute) and node.func.attr == 'eval':
            # In a real tool, you might check the type of node.func.value here
            print(f"SAFE `.eval()` method call found at line {node.lineno}")
            
        self.generic_visit(node) # Continue walking the tree

# 1. Parse the code into an AST
tree = ast.parse(code_to_analyze)

# 2. "Visit" the nodes to apply the rule
visitor = EvalVisitor()
visitor.visit(tree)
```

**Running this script produces:**

```
SAFE `.eval()` method call found at line 12
DANGEROUS `eval` call found at line 16
```

By moving from raw text analysis to AST-based analysis, you are graduating your tool from a simple pattern matcher to a true static analysis engine. This is the single most effective change you can make to drastically reduce false positives and increase the accuracy of your code audits.
